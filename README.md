[Letter]
Dear Sir or Madam,
	I am contacting you in relation to my recent purchase of an Acer 3001 laptop. Firstly, the computer screen failed to display in full color, this was followed by repeated error messages, by which time the computer would usually freeze and crash. 
After trying to fix the problem, I called your shop helpline only to be placed in a queue for ten minutes, after which they said I had to contact you directly.
Due to all of these problems, including the lack of customer service I would like a full refund. I have already returned the laptop, with the receipt and original packaging. Please transfer the funds into the account number supplied.
Regards,
Richard Martin

Dear Sir or Madam,
	I am Frederic Petrov and I am writing in relation to the road refurbishing that takes place near my house. 
Although this repair should last 30 days, it is almost 6 months and stills many workers going back and forth with huge tractors and truckers. Not only the noisy is inconvenience but also the character of the people working there. They are very strange and my wife is not feeling safe with the presence of these road workers. 
Due to all of these problems, I demand certain priority in the part of the road where my house is located. Moreover, the company responsible for the refurbishment should make sure that their employees have no mental health issue. Please, proceed with these actions as soon as possible.
 Thank you in advance.
